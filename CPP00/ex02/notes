Implementation Goals

Static Members Initialization:
  static variables need to be initialized outside the class.
Constructor Logic:
 Assign a unique _accountIndex to each account.
 Increment _nbAccounts and update _totalAmount based on initial_deposit.
Destructor Logic:
 Log the destruction of the account.
 Ensure _nbAccounts decrements.
Deposit and Withdrawal Handling:
 Adjust _amount for each deposit or withdrawal.
 Update _totalAmount, _nbDeposits, or _nbWithdrawals as necessary.
 makeWithdrawal should check if the withdrawal is feasible before proceeding.
Output Formatting:
 Ensure consistency with the log file (e.g., timestamped logs, specific formats).
Helper Methods:
_displayTimestamp: Likely involves fetching and formatting the current time.
Static Method Behavior

Retrieve and display aggregate account statistics.
Likely invoked by the tests.cpp file to verify correctness.
